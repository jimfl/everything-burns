of the reasons I bought the desk. </p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/noodlemgmt/grille.jpg" alt="Cable Management Grille"/></p><p>What I found though is that over time, it just became a very visible 
jumble of wires and zip ties. Making any changes was a pain. I have been
itching to tear it out and re-do the cabling to make it pretty again, but
I knew that eventually it would just get jumbled again. I started to noodle
about ways to keep cables secure, but in a flexible, easy to modify way.</p><p>After some noodling, I finally arrived at pool noodles, which we just happen
to have lying around. Here’s what I came up with. Slice the noodle along the
length. The excess cables go into the slot and hang out in the cavity.</p><p>I wanted to run cables through the entire length of the tube if need be, so I
couldn’t just zip tie the whole noodle around the outer circumference to the
grid. So I drilled some holes in the back side  of the pool noodle, and run the
zip tie through that, along the length of the tube.</p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/noodlemgmt/noodle_hack.png" alt="split noodle"/></p><p>I put three sets of zip tie holes along the 32in. length of pool noodle, and
connected it to the back side  of the grille, facing the wall. It isn’t really
visible from the front side (where I’ve attached a power strip and a power
brick).</p><p>This works great. I discovered that I don’t even have to stuff the whole cable
into the cavity like I originally envisioned, I can just take  the slack into a
loop, and jam the loop into the slot. This makes it easy to re-arrange things as 
needed.</p></div></article></main>

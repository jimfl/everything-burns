in my company, department, or organization seemed to take little interest
in the projects that my team and I were working on.  This can all be very
disheartening, and impact the morale of the team putting all their working
energy into the project.  Too late in my career I learned to think
about interest by senior leadership in a completely different way. I eventually
learned to take this as a good sign under the right conditions.</p><p>The evidence of disinterest by senior leadership can take the form of</p><ul><li>difficulty getting into meetings with the senior leader
</li><li>inattentiveness/lack of participation in meetings by the senior leader. Open laptop/replying to texts/playing video games (this has happened to me. You know who you are.)
</li><li>Project status/presentations near the end of agendas, making them more likely to be dropped as ballast for time reasons
</li><li>Explicit: “I don’t care about this.” (this has happened to me)
</li></ul><p>For the purposes of what follows, a senior leader is someone either at director
or vice president level. Like you, as an individual contributor, these people
have a bunch of things going on, and like you, they need to carefully choose
their battles, because one person can only handle so much cognitive load before
they start to become very ineffective, whether it’s at a tactical level, or a
strategic one.</p><p>So, if a senior leader takes a concentrated interest in your team’s project,
likely one of the following (sometimes both) is true:</p><ul><li>your project has the potential to make them look very good,
</li><li>your project has the potential to make them look very bad.
</li></ul><p>How can you tell one from the other? If you don’t know which it is, working
with your team’s manager on your own situational awareness is probably a good
topic for an upcoming conversation. Signs that your project has the potential
to make the senior leader look good include:</p><ul><li>delivery dates that coincide with internal or customer facing events where product announcements are made
</li><li>the senior leader is exploring if scope can be expanded
</li><li>the senior leader is asking questions about the customer-facing aspects of the project
</li></ul><p>Signs that it’s the other way around</p><ul><li>the project schedule is in open negotiation
</li><li>the senior leader is exploring if scope can be <em>reduced</em></li><li>the senior leader is asking questions about internal process
</li></ul><p>Either way, your team is likely to be facing some increased pressure to perform, which isn’t always fun.
That being said, it’s possible to learn a great deal from senior leaders when they are working closely 
with you and your team. And not always the things they’d prefer you to learn!</p><p>But what can you infer from the apparent lack of interest? Most likely, the
senior leader has delegated the responsibility to the team’s manager or maybe
one level above them. They are trusting that line manager to make reasonable
progress, and the high level signals they receive (status reports, goal-meeting, lack of requests for interference, lack of escalations from dependent
projects) indicate that the project is on track and being well run. It’s not always 
like this; sometimes middle management is, in fact, acutely incompetent. But if you’re
giving the benefit of the doubt, the above should hold.</p></div></article></main>

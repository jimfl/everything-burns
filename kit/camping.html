      <main><article><div><h1 id="tools-and-gear---camping">Tools and Gear - Camping</h1><h2 id="timberleaf-classic-all-road-teardrop">Timberleaf Classic All-road Teardrop</h2><p>In June 2015, Patti and I <a href="https://medium.com/@jim_flanagan/around-iceland-part-1-f240b29ff07a">drove around Iceland in a camper
van</a>.
After that experience, we started talking about seeing the US and
Canada in a similar way, with lots of flexibility and going at ones
own pace, setting up camp without having to plan too far in advance.</p><p>We really like the camper van model for this, but a couple of issues
arose for us.  First, a camper van isn’t practical for one’s only
vehicle, so now you have two vehicles with all the liabilities that
attend them. Second, it’s challenging to plop full-sized hard-sided
sea kayaks on the top of a van.</p><p>So we started looking about for campers that we could tow behind
our Subaru Outback. And that means small. Teardrops seem to fit the
bill, but we needed one that I could fit my 6’3” self into, narrowing
the field any further. We happened to find <a href="https://timberleaftrailers.com/">Timberleaf
Trailers</a>, and reached out, around
the start of COVID.</p><p>The process was really great. They sent a link to a form to customize
all the features we wanted, and the lead time was about 6 months
(It’s currently 12-14 months). They helped us get the right hitch
setup on our car in preparation.</p><p>We drove out to Grand Junction, Colorado in May to pick it up (even
though the owner offered to drive it out to us, since he has friends
who live in the same town as we do), and stayed the first night in
Colorado National Monument before driving back home and camping
along the way.</p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/teardrop.jpg" alt="Teardrop Trailer behind the Soob"/></p><p>The interior finish is wood, and it is basically just a queen-sized
bed (with some storage underneath). There’s a small cabinet at the
head, and more full-sized cabinets at the foot of the bed. Ours has
a door on either size, and a max-air fan to keep air flowing. It
has a propane heater that we’ve never had to use. We got the all-road
package, which means that the trailer can go anywhere the Outback
can.</p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/teardrop_galley.jpg" alt="Teardrop Trailer galley"/></p><p>The back opens up into a very well thought out galley (with a single
exception, that I’ll get to).  On a sliding shelf, there’s a <a href="https://partnersteel.com/shop/ols/products/22-2-burner-partner-stove-with-windscreen">Cook
Partner</a>
two burner stove. This stove is indestructible. On the other side
of the galley, a custom built cooler slides out which has the same
surface as the main galley work surface. So one of us can be prepping,
while the other cooks. Lots of room. Cabinets on the main surface
hold all our dishes and utinsels, and a large drawer under the stove
holds all our pots and pans.</p><p>That’s the one misfeature of the galley arrangement: Once you’ve
pulled the stove out, you can’t really get into the drawer, so you
sort of have to plan ahead and get everything out you’ll need in
advance. Not my strong suit.</p><p>It came with an awning and mount on the back door to cover the work
area. It’s good for <em>most</em> rainy conditions, though the shape of
it really wants to become airborne in really windy conditions). We
also put an aftermarket awning from Cascadia Vehicle Tents over the
door on the right side.</p><p>A deep cycle marine battery powers the fan and the interior and
exterior lights. It seems to last about 4 days when running the fan
all night, and it is charged by the car when travelling.  We decided
to forego the solar charging option given we projected most of our
adventures would be in the Pacific Northwest.</p><h2 id="gazelle-g6-gazebo-tent">Gazelle G6 Gazebo Tent</h2><p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3b0e781a-87f5-4d07-b894-cfc4c837baf2._SR970,300_.png" alt="Gazelle gazebo"/></p></div></article></main>

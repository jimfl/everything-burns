      <main><article><div><h1 id="tag-cloud-influences">Tag Cloud Influences</h1><p>In the mid-1990s, I was working in the Computing and Communications department
at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island, New York as a computer
analyst generalist. The World Wide Web was only a couple of years old and some
enterprising staff and scientists had set up a web presence for the lab, all
users of the system had a personal web space. Like most people with a web page,
I had a page of links of interesting web pages, and after a while, my list had
gotten long enough that it was difficult to organize and find things.</p><p>I decided I would take the random approach, so that every time someone loaded
the page, a different set of links  would be featured. I wrote a CGI program
that rendered each link in a random order, enclosed in a <code class="inline">&lt;font&gt;</code> tag, and
set the color and text size to a random value. I think either CSS hadn’t been
available in all browsers at the time, or I just didn’t know it. So I used
<code class="inline">&lt;font&gt;</code> tags.</p><p>This was just a wall of text of various sizes and colors that changed every
time the page was loaded. It was fun and different from everyone else’s big
bags of links.</p><p>In 1998, I moved back to Seattle, ended up with a DSL internet connection
in my house, and had a linux server in my back room, that hosted the
<code class="inline">tensegrity.net</code> domain, where I eventually hosted a weblog, a wiki, and some
photos, and email for my family. I was an avid Perl programmer, and wrote various 
utilities and CGI programs to help out. For a blogging platform I was using 
MovableType, which had a plugin system.</p><p>I was also a very early user of Flickr. The team that built Flickr was originally
working on a game called <a href="https://gamicus.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Neverending">Game Neverending</a>
(GNE)
which a friend had gotten me into. The team kept adding features to the chat
facility in the game, and eventually it was possible to upload images into chat.
One morning, Stewart Butterfield (alias St. Wart) texted me in GNE
and asked “Have you tried Flickr yet?” They had spun the GNE chat into a separate
app which would become Flickr.</p><p>One of the first plugins I wrote for Movable Type was a widget which used the
Flickr API to list the most recent photos for an account, and show them in the
Movable Type sidebar. You can see an example of it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040919210957/http://jimfl.tensegrity.net/">here</a>.
I think this got the attention of the Flickr team, who may also have clicked on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041009201303/http://jimfl.tensegrity.net/zeitgeist/">Zeitgeist</a>
link in the sidebar.</p><p>The Zeitgeist page was another MovableType plugin I wrote which scanned my web server’s
access log, collated all of the referrals from search engines, and extracted the search
terms. For presentaion of this data, I went back to my page-of-links style of changing the
color and size of the terms. Except this time, instead of random sizes, the size was based
on the frequency of the term in the search referrals.</p><p>You can read more about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041204231120/http://twiki.tensegrity.net/bin/view/Main/SearchReferralZeitgeist">how the search referral zeitgeist plugin worked</a>.</p><p>One interesting anecdote is that the zeitgeist eventually became self-
referential so that search engines would find the page itself, and so certain
terms just snowballed out of control, and the zeitgeist page became the top
result for some terms on some search engines. It  would have been easy to fix,
but I never got around to it. Some of the search terms were somewhat unsavoury,
and I sort of caught a glimpse of the dark underside of the internet. My
favorite snowballed term was “Ewan MacGregor Nude Photos,” which happened
because I mentioned a film in my blog where Ewan MacGregor appeared nude.</p><p>Flickr put the technique to actual taxonomic effect, by representing the
number of photos with a specific tag as a larger font, and they started a
trend.</p><p>Whenever I make the mistake of mentioning my role in this to colleagues, it
always seems to get spread around, and I have to apologise, just like Flickr 
did at the Webby Awards ceremony.</p></div></article></main>

    </p></header><div><p>This morning was one of those popcorn-for-breakfast days when the tech world
learns about some impactful security event with a package or resource that is
depended upon by many teams across many companies and open source or personal
projects.</p><p>GitHub is more or less a core part of the development tooling for many projects
around the world. This morning, GitHub announced that the RSA SSH private key
material for github.com was exposed, and therefore must be replaced with a
different key.  I learned about it by reading about it. Others learned about it
when their automated processes involving GitHub started failing, or when their
manual processes started throwing up scary messages.</p><p>If this event did not break your GitHub connected workflows that use SSH, you
may have a problem. I will try to get into the nature of that problem below.</p><p>In what follows, I will attempt to avoid criticizing GitHub’s handling of this
event or editorialzing about the incident itself. You can help keep me honest 
here by reaching out to @jimfl@hachyderm.io on Mastodon. (Other techies commenting
on the incident are fair game though!)</p><p>The key in question is used to authenticate and identify GitHub in interactions
which use SSH as a transport, so that clients have some assurance that they are
indeed talking to GitHub, and not someone trying to impersonate GitHub.</p><h2 id="what-is-at-stake">What is at stake</h2><p>Many GitHub users were inconvenienced by the failure of their automated
processes, the questions about the GitHub authentication failure messages
to the helpdesk, and the need to update all the systems that interact  with
GitHub to be able to accept (I am actively trying to avoid the word “trust”
throughout) the replacement key.</p><p>These failures are a good thing, and part of the design of SSH, and again,
the lack of failures needs to be  investigated by anyone who “got lucky.”
You should at least verify that you’re using ECDSA or Ed2559 and not RSA keys,
in the absence of an error.
These failures aren’t why many people are upset. And many of the  people who
are upset for the right reasons are, in my opinion, still upset for the wrong
reasons.</p><p>It is important to understand what can go wrong if someone is able to trick
a software developer or automated process into beliving that they are GitHub.
This would allow an attacker to inject whatever source code they pleased into
the code of a package, when a package is pulled down from GitHub to be built.
That’s the biggest danger, though there are likely some other tricky things
that can be accomplished by someone in this position.</p><p>One of the nasty things about public-key cryptography is that that private part
of the key must be kept safe and only usable by the party that it means to 
authenticate. The private key is just a blob of data from which infinite copies can
be made, and it is almost impossible to detect if a copy has been made.</p><h2 id="tr*st-on-first-use-(tofu)">Tr*st On First Use (TOFU)</h2><p>SSH is used to create encrypted and authenticated connections between computers. 
It was introduced in 1995, and has evolved somewhat since then. SSH connections
can be used to protect interactive terminal sessions, run commands on other 
computers, or transfer data. Both the client and server has a public-key pair. 
The client’s private key is used to authenticate them to the system, and the
server’s private key is used to authenticate the server to the client.</p><p>In order to accept each others keys, the server needs to know the public key
of the client, and the client needs to know the public key of the server.
Many of the use cases for SSH were that a handfull of users (clients) would
be using SSH to connect  to a larger number of servers, and so the dynamics of
the way key material was managed  reflect that. public key material resides in
files on the filesystem. As a user, you <em>could</em> go around and collect all the
public keys from all the machines you need to talk to, and put them in your
<code class="inline">known_hosts</code> file, but first, that’s a hassle, and second, the server
authenticating itself to the client is <strong>far and away</strong> less important than the
client authenticating to the server (Right? That’s right, isn’t it?)</p><p>So, as a convenience measure, if the client doesn’t have the public key of the
server, it will give the user an opportunity to accept the public key that was
used in the initial connection as the key for that server going forward. This 
interaction is called “Trust On First Use,” or TOFU for short. The next time
the client makes a connection to that machine, the public key better be the same, 
or an intentionally scary, <code class="inline">ALL CAPS BECAUSE YO, PAY ATTENTION</code> message is 
presented to the client.</p><p>SSH TOFU doesn’t work in the other direction. The server needs to be configured with
the client’s key in advance. Commonly, the user logs in with a username/password,
sets up the key, and then can use SSH from that point forward. Sometimes this
will be done by administrators for the clients.</p><h2 id="other-uses-for-ssh">Other uses for SSH</h2><p>SSH was initially designed for these many-to-many, ad-hoc interactions between
machines, where the authentication of the client was placed above the authentication
of the server to the client. </p><p>SSH is a convenient way to arrange protected communications of many kinds, and even
create ad-hoc private networks, tunnels, and proxies between systems. </p><p>Before GitHub, the git source code manager system was able to be configured to use
SSH to authenticate users and encrypt communications between git repositories on
multiple machines. The git system itself is designed to help developers distributed
across multiple computers coordinate changes to software source code. One common 
pattern that emerged was that there would be a central “repo” which all the developers
would coordinate with. GitHub is this central repository pattern writ large. SSH is only 
one of the ways users authenticate with GitHub, and again, the <em>primary</em> important 
authentication is authenticating the client to the server (Right?)</p><h2 id="critical-response">Critical Response</h2><p>Much of the critical response around this incident centers around how GitHub might 
have better protected the key material used for their server key, which much 
gobsmacked handwringing about why they were not using a Hardware Security Module
to manage the key (HSMs are hard. Really hard. Hard. Escpecially hard to automate 
against in a secure manner).</p><p>But really, I see the problem is the attitude, handed down from decades of SSH 
use, that the authentication of server to client is secondary to the authentication
of client to server, which leads to acceptance of TOFU, around which there are no
tried and true controls. You can replace the server key, which causes everyone a
bad day (imagine Gary Oldman screaming EV-REE-ONE here), but this interacts with
another phenomenon in a potentially destructive way. That phenomenon is normalization 
of deviance. At the end of the day, most of the people who encounter the SSH error
they get from github, are not scared. They’re trying to get something done. They’ve
seen the SSH error a bunch of times. Things go wonky, need to get fixed. Nobody is
actually trying to perpetrate a man-in-the-middle attack. So they will accept the
new key and move on, without deep inspection, and certainly no verification of the
gibberish-looking key signature for the new key.</p><p>What this means is that there is still an attack vector against people who have
not yet  tried to connect to GitHub. They’ll get the error, their colleague
will say “Oh, yeah, GitHub had to rotate their key,” and they’ll accept the new
key, which might not be from GitHub.</p><p>The simple fact is that for a critical resource of the scale and impact of
GitHub,  authentication of the service is equally important as authentication
of the clients,  the TOFU dynamic cannot provide the assurances it should.
You can be assured that some actors  are feverishly trying to work out how to
exploit straggler users who have not yet  updated their local copy to the new
GitHub key.</p></div></article></main>

<a href="https://www.tideraceseakayaks.com/">Tiderace</a> that I bought on 
Craigslist for about half the MSRP. </p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/XPLOR.jpg" alt="XPLOR"/></p><p>The previous owner made several personal modifications:</p><ul><li>deck rigging beads for daytime visibility
</li><li>reflectve decklines and bungies for nighttime visibility
</li><li>aftermarket closed cell foam seat
</li><li>textured tape behind the cockpit to make it grippier for when you put your hands behind the
cockpit to adjust your position in the seat.
</li><li>blocks on the foot pegs (which I removed, so I could fit)
</li></ul><p>I learned a few things just from observing how the modifications were made.</p><p>The foam seat allowed me to rasp out additional material so that
the kayak fits me snugly.  The previous owner sold the boat because
it was too tippy for him. It has low initial stability, which is a
good trait: it makes it easier to edge the boat for turning. This
boat also has a fair amount of rocker—the curve of the keel from
front to back—which also makes it easier to turn while on edge.</p><h2 id="astral-bluejacket-pfd">Astral BlueJacket PFD</h2><p>My <a href="https://astraldesigns.com/products/bluejacket?variant=42350441627862">BlueJacket</a>
is red, which might be a little confusing. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0609/6840/3158/products/Astral-LifeJacket-BlueJacket-CherryCreekRed-Front_1920x.png?v=1655335082" alt="BlueJacket"/></p><p>A PFD is a necessary bit of kit in all conditions. Getting your act
together after an accidental swim is much more relaxed if you don’t
have to tread water. A major reason people don’t want to wear a PFD
is that they can be constricting. The BlueJacket is the most
comfortable PFD I’ve ever worn, and is easy to get on and off. It is
an extremely well-thought-out product.</p><p>The single zippered pocket has a stiff outer shell, and it opens
out like a hungry cookie monster, revealing multiple mesh zippered
pockets, and some open slip pockets for organizing stuff. Even with
things in the internal pockets there’s still room for larger things
(I usually keep my phone or gloves or a VHF radio in the main
pocket). The main pocket floats on adjustable webbing straps with
a space behind it. You can stuff things like gloves behind the
picket and cinch it down, or you can use the space behind as a hand
warmer. There’s a mesh panel at the bottom of the space to prevent
things from falling out.</p><p>Nice touches on this PFD are that the straps that tighten around
the waist and midsection (there are 3 on each side) have hook and
loop at the tips, which allows the loose ends to stay in place
against the panel on in front rather than flap all around.</p><p>I haven’t really found a use for the two mesh pockets on either side of the belt.
They’re fairly small, and much less easy to access than the large main pocket.</p><p>There are 2 lash tabs on the front straps, and 2 in back, and there is space for a hydration
pack in back with tube access. There’s also a small tunnel near the bottom of each strap that
allows you to string, say, headphone cables or whatnot from the main pocket to the outside 
without interfering with closing the pocket.</p><h2 id="deepzoom">DeepZoom</h2><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/DeepZoom.png" alt="DeepZoom"/></p><p>The Salish Sea is a tidal body of water. The tide comes in, the tide goes out; 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzkRHFl2ppw">you can’t explain that</a>. The tides 
effect how far you have to carry your boat and gear from the car to the water, or whether 
the place you plan to land for lunch will be boot-sucking mud when you get there. 
Water flowing around obstructions like islands and headlands also creates currents, eddies,
and tide rips. So it’s important when planning a trip to understand what the water is going 
to be doing. Traditionally, paddling maps often have indicators on them to help corrolate
current in the area with known tide stations, but it’s pretty tedious to do all those
calculations by hand. </p><p><a href="https://deepzoom.com/">DeepZoom</a> takes that data and puts it on a dynamic map with sliders that
show the change over time, with arrows that change direction and size with the magnitude of the 
current. It also allows you to plot routes, then set launch times and average speeds, then “play”
the trip, and see how the currents change as you proceed along the route.</p><p>This last feature allowed me on a recent trip to circumnavigate an island with a tricky passage
at one point, and hit that passage right at slack current when the water was going to be the
least troublesome. </p><p>Another way I use it is to make PDFs of the daily graphs of current stations in the area I will 
be in, and put them on my phone, which enables more spontaneous on the fly decisions or day-trips.</p></div></article></main>

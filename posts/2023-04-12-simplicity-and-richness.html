that later I could play around with ways to present and organize feeds and entries. The shape, format, and contents
of RSS feeds vary wildly, and I wanted a way to quickly review what sorts of things I was getting in different 
feeds. Markdown seemed like the simplest thing that could possibly work, so I whipped up some code to spit out
a feed as markdown, where each of the entries looks like this</p><pre><code class="">### [When I&#39;m An Astronaut](https://www.metafilter.com/198913/When-Im-An-Astronaut)
* author: box 
* date: 2023-04-10
* #dreampop, #ethereal, #indierock, #music, #shoegaze</code></pre><p>into a file named <code class="inline">&lt;feed title&gt;.md</code>. Nothing could be more low-tech.</p><p>I use <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a> to take notes, which uses markdown to store notes, and can also open 
directories of existing markdown files, so I opened the folder in Logseq, and what I saw surprised me. Logseq
creates an index of pages, and creates references between them, wiki-style, if you mention another page by
surrounding its title with <code class="inline">[[]]</code>. Logseq also uses a hashtag notation for grouping pages together by tags. So my format
contained a happy accident. In addition, Logseq has a journal format. Any time you open the journal, it adds a section
for today’s date at the top. If you ping a date in any other page like <code class="inline">[[2023-04-10]]</code>
then the page gets linked into that journal entry for that day. </p><p>Realizing this, I made a simple change to my markdown template to look like this instead:</p><pre><code class="">### [When I&#39;m An Astronaut](https://www.metafilter.com/198913/When-Im-An-Astronaut)
* author: box [[2023-04-10]]
* #[[dreampop]], #[[ethereal]], #[[indierock]], #[[music]], #[[shoegaze]]</code></pre><p>Now, here is what the MetaFilter page looks like in Logseq</p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/logseq/logseq_feed.png" alt="MetaFilter feed page in Logseq"/></p><p>For the feed pages, I did end up using some Logseq-specific markdown at the top for the feed metadata. Here’s the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/eex/main/EEx.html">EEx</a> template:</p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/logseq/feed_template.png" alt="EEx template"/></p><p>Here’s a page that gets generated for the <code class="inline">#Art</code> tag. Note that this page doesn’t get clobbered when I overwite
the individual feed pages, the entries that are taged <code class="inline">#Art</code> just get linked into the “Linked References” section. 
Any notes I type in the page istelf are retained.</p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/logseq/logseq_tag.png" alt="Art tag page in Logseq"/></p><p>Here’s the journal page. Just like the tag pages, the feed entries are just referenced (and nicely grouped by feed).</p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/logseq/logseq_journal.png" alt="Journal section in Logseq"/></p><p>All of this is done for free by Logseq. All I did was dump the markdown into one <code class="inline">.md</code> file per feed.</p><p>Here’s perhaps the coolest feature: The Logseq graph view:</p><p><img src="/everything-burns/media/logseq/logseq_graph.png" alt="Graph view in Logseq"/></p><p>This really does work as a very rudimentary feed reader, all kind of by accident.</p><p>One of this things I learned in this exercise is that the RSS feed for this site could use some improvements. I’ll
spare you the screenshot of my Logseq TODO list.</p></div></article></main>
